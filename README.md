# SE_Day1
Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
  SE applies engineering principles to software development, ensuring reliability, scalability, and efficiency. It is vital for quality, cost-effectiveness, and security in tech industries

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
  1968: The term "Software Engineering" introduced at NATO conference.
  1970s-1980s: Rise of structured programming (e.g., C language).
  1990s-Present: Agile and DevOps revolutionize development.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
  Requirement Analysis – Define needs.
  Design – Plan architecture.
  Implementation – Write code.
  Testing – Ensure functionality.
  Deployment – Release software.
  Maintenance – Fix and update.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
  Waterfall: Linear, suitable for stable requirements (e.g., government projects).
  Agile: Iterative, flexible (e.g., evolving mobile apps).

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
  Software Developer – Codes and maintains software.
  QA Engineer – Tests and ensures quality.
  Project Manager – Manages timelines and coordination.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
  IDEs: Streamline coding (e.g., VS Code, IntelliJ IDEA).
  VCS: Manage code changes (e.g., Git, GitHub).

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
  Complexity – Use modular programming.
  Deadlines – Follow Agile methodologies.
  Security Risks – Implement secure coding practices.
  Tech Advancements – Continuous learning.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
  Unit – Tests components.
  Integration – Ensures modules work together.
  System – Validates entire application.
  Acceptance – Confirms business requirements.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
  Designing prompts to optimize AI responses. Essential for precise and relevant outputs.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
  Vague: "Tell me about AI."
  Improved: "Explain AI, including its definition, key uses in healthcare and finance, and future trends."
